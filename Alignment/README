HEY DUMMY!!!!!!!!!
DO THIS vvvvvvvvvv

DO THIS ^^^^^^^^^^


Contents

Alignment.py             <--  The main Python script used. See comments for details
Cangmom.cpp              <--  C++ code for angular momentum coupling coefficients
Cangmom.cpython-32mu.so  <--  compiled shared library, linked with boost so that it's
                                 accessible with Python
setup.py                 <--  script to compile Cangmom.cpp. to use, type
                                 python3 setup.py build
                                 or
                                 python setup.py build
                                 if you use python2.x, some things may need to be changed
                                 in Alignment.py, e.g. the top line and print statements.
                                 The compiled library will be in build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.2
                                 and you should copy it to the working directory.
knockdif.output          <-- an example output of the knockdif code, giving m-state
                                 population from a knockout reaction
state_9                  <-- an example file of m-state population for pickup, from
